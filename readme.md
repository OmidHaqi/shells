### Shell Setup Instructions

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omidhaqi/shells.git
cd shells
```

#### 2. Choose Your Shell

Navigate to the directory of the shell you'd like to install. For example, to install the **Kali-ZSH**:

```bash
cd kali-zsh
```

#### 3. Run the Installation Script

Inside the chosen shell folder, there is an `install.sh` script. Simply execute it to begin the installation process.

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The installation script will:

- Install required packages.
- Set up the shell as the default for the current user.
- Configure additional features (like syntax highlighting, autosuggestions, themes, etc.)
- Ask if youâ€™d like to reboot the system to finalize the setup.
